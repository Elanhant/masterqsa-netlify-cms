  title: Why MasterQSA
  description: >+
    MasterQSA is a software as a service (SaaS) solution for security compliance
    reporting.


description: >-
  MasterQSA improves the PCI compliance report creation process for both
  professional security assessors and the employees of the merchant being
  assessed. On top of this improved experience, MasterQSA lowers the cost of
  report creation and improves QSA productivity. With MasterQSA, a QSA company
  can efficiently complete more reports, creating a competitive advantage and
  enabling them to win more business.

        Our mission is to provide QSA companies and professionals with a tool to
        automate the creation of PCI reports. Our product, MasterQSA, will
        facilitate a QSA professional’s work by providing guidance throughout
        report creation, and provide a convenient, web-based channel to
        collaborate with and gather information from their clients. By
        automating what were previously manual processes and providing guidance
        to help QSAs better understand the report fields, we believe our tool
        can cut both the time required to compile these reports and the cost of
        the effort in half. Additionally, we believe our web-based interface
        will streamline and improve the report creation experience for the
        merchants working with the QSA companies. As such, we believe our tool
        provides a competitive advantage for QSA companies that choose to use
        it. 
  heading: What we offer
  description: >
    MasterQSA features a report template builder, wizard-based guided UX,
    project management tools, and means for collaboration and secure information
    exchange. We utilize a robust quality assurance process to support the
    strictest requirements around security assessment and reporting. As
    merchants can choose to report using either of the two most recent versions
    of PCI report requirements, we enable users to choose which version they
    wish to use, and we can quickly respond to changes in PCI council
    requirements.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
