  - title: Focused on Customer Service
    description: "MasterQSA is a customer driven company.  Our mission is focused on one thing:  “Develop tools to empower compliance assessors”.  Every feature in our products has been built with one thing in mind, our customers.  We listen to what our customers are asking for and we don’t stop until we have developed those features.  As a MasterQSA customer, you have an open line of communication to our customer service reps, our programmers, our managers and to the leadership.  Please submit ideas for product improvements.  Each quarter, if you are the first to submit an idea that we place in our backlog, you will be rewarded with license credits!"
  - title: Passionate about Productivity
    description: When we started MasterQSA we had a good reason to do so.  We knew that performing PCI assessments for merchants and service providers was a difficult and arduous process.  We knew that very few options existed to simplify the process.  We also knew that the cost of anything available put it out of reach for many assessor firms.  What makes us unique is not only do we have a sensible pricing model, but our product is 100% focused on improving productivity.  You will spend more valuable time helping your customers rather than using the PCI Counsel’s template for ROC completion.  
  - title: Developed by QSAs
    description: MasterQSA is QSA / ISA focused.  We know how you think, how you prefer to operate, and we know you are busy.  We have incorporated features into our products to take the headaches out of assessments so yu can focus on higher quality outcomes, not scheduling meetings and trying to keep up with 10 different ROC projects at the same time.  Try our products absolutely free for 30 days and see how MasterQSA can transform your business.

### Shade-grown coffee
Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

### Single origin
Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.

### Sustainable farming
Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
