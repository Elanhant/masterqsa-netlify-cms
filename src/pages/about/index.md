intro:
  description: >-
    MasterQSA improves the PCI-DSS assessment process for both professional
    security assessors  (QSA and ISA personnel) and the employees of the
    merchant or service provider being assessed. On top of this, MasterQSA
    lowers the cost of PCI-DSS assessments, improves consistency of outcomes,
    improves overall accuracy and accountability and increases QSA / ISA
    productivity as well as the productivity of those being assessed.

  - title: Focused on Customer Service
    description: >-
      MasterQSA is a customer driven company.  Our mission is focused on one
      thing:  “Develop tools to empower compliance assessors”.  Every feature in
      our products has been built with one thing in mind, our customers.  We
      listen to what our customers are asking for and we don’t stop until we
      have developed those features.  As a MasterQSA customer, you have an open
      line of communication to our customer service reps, our programmers, our
      managers and to the leadership.  Please submit ideas for product
      improvements.  Each quarter, if you are the first to submit an idea that
      we place in our backlog, you will be rewarded with license credits!

  - title: Passionate about Productivity
    description: >-
      When we started MasterQSA we had a good reason to do so.  We knew that
      performing PCI assessments for merchants and service providers was a
      difficult and arduous process.  We knew that very few options existed to
      simplify the process.  We also knew that the cost of anything available
      put it out of reach for many assessor firms.  What makes us unique is not
      only do we have a sensible pricing model, but our product is 100% focused
      on improving productivity.  You will spend more valuable time helping your
      customers rather than using the PCI Counsel’s template for ROC completion.
