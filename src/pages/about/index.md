Every feature in our products has been built with one thing in mind, our customers.  We listen to what our customers are asking for and we don’t stop until we have developed those features.  As a MasterQSA customer, you have an open line of communication to our customer service reps, our programmers, our managers and to the leadership.  Please submit ideas for product improvements.  Each quarter, if you are the first to submit an idea that we place in our backlog, you will be rewarded with license credits!"

  - title: Passionate about Productivity
    description: When we started MasterQSA we had a good reason to do so.  We knew that performing PCI assessments for merchants and service providers was a difficult and arduous process.  We knew that very few options existed to simplify the process.  We also knew that the cost of anything available put it out of reach for many assessor firms.  What makes us unique is not only do we have a sensible pricing model, but our product is 100% focused on improving productivity.  You will spend more valuable time helping your customers rather than using the PCI Counsel’s template for ROC completion.
